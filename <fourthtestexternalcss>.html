        <h1> External CSS!</h1>
        <p> I am a little confused about how the CSS hierarchy works.</p>
        <p2> omg wait you can have different levels of paragraphs?<br>
        That makes more sense, because then you could style two different <br>
        levels of paragraph text and have unique styling for each of them. I guess <br> 
        the idea here is that websites generally have a uniform style, and there is <br>
        no need to have more dynamic styling in a given unit. For example, you usually <br>
        wouldn't have 3 different styles of H1 text text. PS: I learned how to do line breaks lol. </p2>

        <h2> Divs and Spans!</h2>
        <div>
            <p2> This first text is in a div. It has a defined width and hieght of <span class="highlight">by 250 px</span> </p2>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <!--This is a comment to seperate the two divs.--> 
        <div> 
            <p2> Suprise, second text is also in a div. It looks kind of stupid but it's interesting to see how divs work. 
                The width of this is <span class="highlight">250 pixels</span> by the way, in case anyone is reading this. I do wanna
                Know what it looks like if I write further than the div can hold. if this box is a different shape
                Than the other one you know it's because I wrote a lot of text, and the div adapted to fit it's contents. 
                Ok... so my div didn't expand the first time and the text overflowed the div and poured onto the body below.
                The problem I had is that I defined a hieght of all divs, now they should both allow for overflow / fit text.
             </p2> 
        </div>
        <h2>Using classes to change div styles.</h2>
        <div class="finaldiv">
            <p2> Let's try a class to make a different color, fixed size div without overflow. Ok, it works! Classes, baby!</p2>
        </div>
    </body>
